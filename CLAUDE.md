## Project Context

This is a Go CLI tool for parsing KubeVirt CI health data and reporting failed tests. The tool helps developers and maintainers analyze test failures from the kubevirt/ci-health project by providing various filtering and grouping options.

## Testing Commands

When making changes, ensure the tool builds and runs correctly:

```bash
go build
./healthcheck --help
```

Test different functionality modes:
- `./healthcheck -j compute` - Filter by job regex
- `./healthcheck -c` - Count failures
- `./healthcheck --lane-run` - Group by lane run UUID
- `./healthcheck -f` - Show failure details
